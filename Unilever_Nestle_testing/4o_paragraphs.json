In China we needed to adapt our \nportfolio to reconnect with the fast-changing expectations of \nthe Chinese consumer. Therefore, in addition to correcting \ntrade stocks throughout the year, we focused on innovation, \non reformulation and on re-launches, particularly in coffee, \nready-to-drink and confectionery. We continued to see good \nperformances in ambient culinary, ice cream and ready-to-\ndrink coffee. In Oceania we are focused on developing new \ntrade channels.\nStrong growth continued in most other emerging mar-\nkets, in particular the Philippines, South Asia, the Indochina \nregion, Turkey and many markets in Africa. We introduced \nnew premium noodles in Singapore and Malaysia. In the \n Philippines the new fortified Bear Brand milk powders were \nwell received. Maggi created a new breakfast option for the \nIndian market, Maggi Oats Noodles, and Nestl\u00e9 Milo Activ-Go \nwas launched in parts of South East Asia. It was also rolled \nout in Africa, helping to deliver good growth across the \n continent.\nStrong innovation in products and business models drove \nperformance in Japan with the coffee systems Nescaf\u00e9 Dolce \nGusto and Nescaf\u00e9 Gold Blend Barista doing well and KitKat \nmaintaining its growth momentum. \nThe Zone\u2019s trading operating profit margin was 18.7%, \ndown 20 basis points, mainly due to slower growth, input \ncost increases and some exceptional items.",
