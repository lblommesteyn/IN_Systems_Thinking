focus on cost control and margin improvement. Although our

tainty in 2014. Disruptive socio-economic and political change 
continued to affect growth in many parts of the world. In the 
emerging markets, economic volatility worsened as growth 
rates slowed and currencies weakened. In the developed 
markets, deflationary pressures and soft consumer demand 
resulted in a continued challenging trading environment. In 
the face of such uncertainty it was more important than ever 
to stay the course and remain loyal to our strategy, driving 
short-term performance while ensuring we made the right 
decisions to deliver our long-term goals. We took decisive 
steps to further our ambition to be the world’s recognised 
leading Nutrition, Health and Wellness company, trusted by 
all stakeholders, while again delivering financial results in 
2014 that outperformed the market. 
Sales were CHF 91.6 billion, with organic growth of 4.5%, 
composed of real internal growth of 2.3% and pricing of 
2.2%. The Group’s trading operating profit was CHF 14.0 bil-
lion and the margin increased by 10 basis points to 15.3%, 
up 30 basis points in constant currencies. This performance 
was achieved whilst we again increased consumer facing 
marketing support for our brands. The net profit rose to 
CHF 14.5 billion. The CHF 4.4 billion increase in net profit also 
reflects the profit realised on the disposal of part of the stake 
in L’Oréal and the revaluation gain on the 50% of Galderma  
already held when the Group brought its ownership from 50% 
to 100% (see below). Earnings per share were CHF 4.54, up 
44.6%. Underlying earnings per share were up 4.4% in con-
stant currencies. The Group’s operating cash flow remained 
strong at CHF 14.7 billion. In view of this performance and the 
company’s strong financial position, the Board is proposing 
a dividend of CHF 2.20 per share up from CHF 2.15 last year.
Through continuous innovation and renovation of our food

the quality of people’s diets, using our knowledge and our 
research and development capability to make a positive con-
tribution to society. Wherever you are in the world, we have 
safe, nutritious products to help you care for yourself and 
your family. A few years ago, we expanded the boundaries

into effect in December 2015. To ensure consistent and effec-

developed and external stakeholders are encouraged to pro-
vide feedback via our Tell us reporting mechanism. We have 
phased out our marketing communication in schools and 
reinforced our health and wellness education activities, par-
ticularly those that positively impact children’s development 
and support governments’ goals to increase physical activity. 
By the end of 2014 the Nestlé Healthy Kids programme 
was in 73 countries, supporting initiatives which demonstrate 
how appropriate nutrition and exercise can improve the health 
of children and their communities. In addition, our own stud-
ies in four countries have shown that two thirds of children 
are insufficiently hydrated when they arrive at school. In 2014 
we provided tools and information that schools, parents and 
caregivers need to ensure children learn about the benefits of 
healthy hydration. 
United for Healthier Kids is a platform, created by Nestlé 
in 2014, where society can engage and collaborate to find 
ways to improve the health and wellness of children, from 
conception to the age of 12 years. In Mexico, a TV series was 
launched which supports and encourages five families look-
ing to change their eating and lifestyle habits over six months. 
The platform has also been launched in the Philippines.
Through innovation and renovation we continue to make 
our products tastier and healthier. In line with the recommen-
dations from public health authorities, we are reducing the 
amount of salt, sugar and saturated fats in our products as 
part of our contribution towards the fight against non-com-
municable diseases in society. Our reduction targets are in-
cluded in our public nutrition commitments (detailed in the 
Nestlé in society report) so our progress can be measured. 
We are also ensuring that whole grains are the primary ingre-
dient in our breakfast cereals for children and teenagers. 
We want to help people who buy our products to make 
informed decisions by giving them better nutritional infor-
mation on our product labels. We are enhancing our portion 
guidance and have committed to print GDAs (Guideline Daily 
Amounts) on the front of all relevant packaging. These make 
it easier for people to see how much salt, sugar or fat is in the 
product, and how the amounts compare to reference daily 
guidelines. Nestlé Portion Guidance is a voluntary initiative",Nestle

The slower growth in the Zone was due to our largest mar-
ket China and to Oceania. In China we needed to adapt our 
portfolio to reconnect with the fast-changing expectations of 
the Chinese consumer. Therefore, in addition to correcting 
trade stocks throughout the year, we focused on innovation, 
on reformulation and on re-launches, particularly in coffee, 
ready-to-drink and confectionery. We continued to see good 
performances in ambient culinary, ice cream and ready-to-
drink coffee. In Oceania we are focused on developing new 
trade channels.
Strong growth continued in most other emerging mar-
kets, in particular the Philippines, South Asia, the Indochina 
region, Turkey and many markets in Africa. We introduced 
new premium noodles in Singapore and Malaysia. In the 
 Philippines the new fortified Bear Brand milk powders were 
well received. Maggi created a new breakfast option for the 
Indian market, Maggi Oats Noodles, and Nestlé Milo Activ-Go 
was launched in parts of South East Asia. It was also rolled 
out in Africa, helping to deliver good growth across the 
 continent.
Strong innovation in products and business models drove 
performance in Japan with the coffee systems Nescafé Dolce 
Gusto and Nescafé Gold Blend Barista doing well and KitKat 
maintaining its growth momentum.
