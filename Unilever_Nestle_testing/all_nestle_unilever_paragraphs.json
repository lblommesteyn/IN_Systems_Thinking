In the emerging markets, economic volatility worsened as growth rates slowed and currencies weakened. In the developed markets, deflationary pressures and soft consumer demand resulted in a continued challenging trading environment. In the face of such uncertainty it was more important than ever to stay the course and remain loyal to our strategy, driving short-term performance while ensuring we made the right decisions to deliver our long-term goals. We took decisive steps to further our ambition to be the world’s recognised leading Nutrition, Health and Wellness company, trusted by all stakeholders, while again delivering financial results in 2014 that outperformed the market."

Wherever you are in the world, we have safe, nutritious products to help you care for yourself and your family. A few years ago, we expanded the boundaries of Nutrition, Health and Wellness with the creation of Nestlé Health Science, motivated by the opportunity to forge a major therapeutic role for nutrition in the management of health. In line with this broadened strategy, in 2014 the Board approved the sale of 48.5 million L’Oréal shares to L’Oréal for cancella tion. Part of the proceeds were used for the acquisition of the 50% stake in our joint venture Galderma from L’Oréal, bring ing our ownership of Galderma to 100%. Galderma formed the foundation of a new Nestlé subsidiary, Nestlé Skin Health. Its goal is to be recognised as the leading company in skin health, offering science-based solutions to protect, nourish and enhance skin, and where needed to treat, correct and restore damaged skin over the course of people’s lives. Nestlé Skin Health provides prescription drugs, self-medication, therapeutic skin care and aesthetic and corrective medi cine, allowing us to compete in the growing and promising multi-billion global skincare market. Nestlé Skin Health was further strengthened by the acquisition of the full rights to commercialise several key aesthetic dermatology products in the United States and Canada."

The progress on our second goal is more mixed. We have achieved zero non-hazardous waste to landfill from our factories, and continue to make significant reductions in the greenhouse gas (GHG) and water impacts of our manufacturing. But the consumer element of our target to halve the water and GHG impacts of our products remains a challenge. On waste reduction, new technology such as the roll-out of compressed deodorant sprays and our new Dove Body Wash bottles has enabled reductions. On our third goal, we are also making good progress. We are now sourcing more than half our agricultural raw materials sustainably and have reached around 800,000 smallholder farmers with help and training. We have created 70,000 women micro-entrepreneurs distributing our products in India while making progress on our new commitments to enhance livelihoods across the value chain."
