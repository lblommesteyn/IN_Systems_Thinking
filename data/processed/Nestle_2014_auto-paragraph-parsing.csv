Disruptive socio-economic and political change continued to affect growth in many parts of the world. In the emerging markets, economic volatility worsened as growth rates slowed and currencies weakened. In the developed markets, deflationary pressures and soft consumer demand resulted in a continued challenging trading environment. In the face of such uncertainty it was more important than ever to stay the course and remain loyal to our strategy, driving short-term performance while ensuring we made the right decisions to deliver our long-term goals. We took decisive steps to further our ambition to be the world's recognised leading Nutrition, Health and Wellness company, trusted by all stakeholders, while again delivering financial results in 2014 that outperformed the market. Sales were CHF 91.6 billion, with organic growth of 4.5%, composed of real internal growth of 2.3% and pricing of 2.2%. The Group's trading operating profit was CHF 14.0 billion and the margin increased by 10 basis points to 15.3%, up 30 basis points in constant currencies. This performance was achieved whilst we again increased consumer facing marketing support for our brands."
text,5,1,data/raw/Nestle_2014_auto-paragraph-parsing.pdf,"The net profit rose to CHF 14.5 billion. The CHF 4.4 billion increase in net profit also reflects the profit realised on the disposal of part of the stake in L'Oréal and the revaluation gain on the 50% of Galderma already held when the Group brought its ownership from 50% to 100% (see below). Earnings per share were CHF 4.54, up 44.6%. Underlying earnings per share were up 4.4% in constant currencies. The Group's operating cash flow remained strong at CHF 14.7 billion. In view of this performance and the company's strong financial position, the Board is proposing a dividend of CHF 2.20 per share up from CHF 2.15 last year. Through continuous innovation and renovation of our food and beverages portfolio we are able to offer people healthier and tastier choices at every stage of their life, at any time of the day."

Part of the proceeds were used for the acquisition of the 50% stake in our joint venture Galderma from L'Oréal, bringing our ownership of Galderma to 100%. Galderma formed the foundation of a new Nestlé subsidiary, Nestlé Skin Health. Its goal is to be recognised as the leading company in skin health, offering science-based solutions to protect, nourish and enhance skin, and where needed to treat, correct and restore damaged skin over the course of people's lives. Nestlé Skin Health provides prescription drugs, self-medication, therapeutic skin care and aesthetic and corrective medicine, allowing us to compete in the growing and promising multi-billion global skincare market. Nestlé Skin Health was further strengthened by the acquisition of the full rights to commercialise several key aesthetic dermatology products in the United States and Canada. These developments ensure that, building on the strong foundations of our food and beverages business and guided increasingly by science, we can further expand our portfolio to provide promising platforms for future growth in line with our strategy of Nutrition, Health and Wellness. At the same time, we continue the drive to ensure our company is organised efficiently and effectively to deliver continuous profitable growth over the long term. With this objective in mind we made some key decisions, adapting our organisational structure to better prepare ourselves today to meet the challenges of tomorrow. While our company continues to benefit from its decentralised structure, allowing key decisions to be made as close as possible to consumers, there is still an important opportunity to better leverage our scale."

We made choices about where we wanted to invest, where we wanted to improve, and what we wanted to divest. Making such choices enables us to align our resources behind our best ideas, products and categories, to deliver sustained financial performance and help us on our journey to recognised Nutrition, Health and Wellness leadership over the short term and the long term. We also announced new investments and research collaborations, which will enhance our ability to deliver science-based solutions to improve the quality of people's lives.

The Board of Directors has actively supported the decisions we have taken to further strengthen our Nutrition, Health and Wellness strategy in 2014. It carried out a review of the Wyeth acquisition, received an update on Nestlé Professional, and visited our operations in France, where the discussions included a focus on Nestlé Waters. The Board discussed our global strategy in November, and reviewed our business in the United States, as well as Nestlé Nutrition, Nestlé Health Science and Nestlé Skin Health.

At our next AGM in April, we will for the first time submit our proposals for the compensation of the Board of Directors and the Executive Board for approval by our shareholders as required by the new legislation. We have implemented these measures in a manner designed to preserve legal certainty, while ensuring that compensation remains competitive.

Although we are operating in a challenging and turbulent economic environment, we see these as fascinating times, full of opportunities. We continue to commit ourselves to ambitious financial targets.

As the world's leading food and beverage company we have a responsibility to use our knowledge and our research and development capability to make a positive difference to society.

Start Healthy Stay Healthy is our interactive, science-based education programme designed to help parents and caregivers provide nutritionally and developmentally adequate nutrition in the crucial first 1000 days of life. We support and promote breastfeeding as the best start a baby can have in life. Our educational programmes are targeted at people who are most involved in implementing good practices during this important early period in a child's development. We help to guide parents and caregivers to raise healthier children and help healthcare professionals have a greater impact on the nutritional aspects of care of future generations. We continue to reinforce our leadership in the area of children's nutrition. By the end of 2014 98% of all our products for children met the Nestlé Nutritional Foundation criteria for children. These criteria are based on nutrition science and public health dietary recommendations from bodies such as the World Health Organization and the Institute of Medicine.

To ensure consistent and effective implementation, detailed internal guidelines have been developed and external stakeholders are encouraged to provide feedback via our Tell us reporting mechanism. We have phased out our marketing communication in schools and reinforced our health and wellness education activities, particularly those that positively impact children's development and support governments' goals to increase physical activity. By the end of 2014 the Nestlé Healthy Kids programme was in 73 countries, supporting initiatives which demonstrate how appropriate nutrition and exercise can improve the health of children and their communities. In addition, our own studies in four countries have shown that two thirds of children are insufficiently hydrated when they arrive at school. In 2014 we provided tools and information that schools, parents and caregivers need to ensure children learn about the benefits of healthy hydration. United for Healthier Kids is a platform, created by Nestlé in 2014, where society can engage and collaborate to find ways to improve the health and wellness of children, from conception to the age of 12 years.

We also provide a conducive environment for our employees to breastfeed, such as through flexible work arrangements. Start Healthy Stay Healthy: nurturing a healthier generation together We provide high-quality, innovative, scienceproven nutrition for mothers and infants. The importance of the right nutrition and feeding practices during the first 1000 days of life, from conception to a child's second birthday, is now widely accepted by the public health community. Our Start Healthy Stay Healthy programme is dedicated to supporting mothers and caregivers to get nutrition right in the first 1000 days. Good nutrition is crucial for health, growth and development, and establishing the right feeding practices in early childhood also supports the establishment of good eating habits. We promote and support breastfeeding which is the best start a baby can have in life. Where breastfeeding is not possible, we provide breast-milk substitutes. In addition, we have developed science-based nutritional solutions for infants with specific medical needs, who are unable to absorb, digest or metabolise standard infant formulas and are at risk of death or abnormal development without access to these products. We also provide a range of complementary foods, such as infant cereals and meals and drinks. These baby foods contain carefully selected high-quality ingredients and are fortified with nutrients to meet the specific needs of infants in this important phase of life. We market our breast-milk substitutes in line with the aims and principles of the World Health Organization's International Code of Marketing of Breast-Milk Substitutes as implemented by governments. Our marketing standards are the strictest in the industry."

Nestlé Purina scientists, veterinarians and nutritionists have been studying the effects of ageing on pets since 1986, when Purina began the breakthrough 'Lifespan Study' of canine diets. Around age seven a dog's glucose metabolism in the brain begins to change, which can affect memory, learning, awareness or decision-making. Our scientists have discovered that medium chain triglycerides (MCTs) in certain botanical oils can be used as an additional alternative source of energy for the brain in these ageing dogs. Our scientists have also developed a proprietary brain protection blend that includes fish oil to promote cognitive function in cats and dogs. Extensive testing in cats and dogs demonstrated improved cognitive and learning ability in pets fed this blend. Nutritional benefits Purina Pro Plan Bright Mind helps support cognitive function in pets. Better together Nestlé Purina PetCare hosted its second 'Better with Pets' summit in New York as a forum for discussing a range of pet care issues.

Presidential greeting Then-President of the Swiss Confederation, Didier Burkhalter, is greeted by Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Nestlé Chairman, at the 2014 Creating Shared Value Forum in Switzerland. Creating Shared Value - our way of doing business It is our fundamental belief that for a company to prosper over the long term we need to create value for shareholders while at the same time creating value for society. We call this Creating Shared Value. In the Nestlé in society report we detail our progress towards meeting our 38 Creating Shared Value commitments (including three new ones for 2014). These commitments, which we introduced in 2013, make it possible for stakeholders to hold us accountable, while at the same time encouraging our management, and all our employees, to achieve continuous improvement. Creating Shared Value requires compliance with the highest standards of business practice, including international codes and standards as well as our own. Global companies like Nestlé have a role to play and can make a valuable contribution to the efforts to address some of the critical issues the world faces, such as food security, nutrition and health, water, sustainability and human rights. Our Creating Shared Value approach focuses the business on the long term, where the success of society and economic activity are intertwined and mutually reinforcing. In 2014, at our sixth Creating Shared Value Forum, held in Switzerland, participants discussed how civil society and the private sector could work in partnership to strengthen and speed up sustainable development, focusing on the key areas of nutrition, water and rural development."

Zero water - reducing water use in Mexico In 2014, we transformed a dairy factory in Mexico into the company's first 'zero water' manufacturing site in the world. Cow's milk is 88% water, so by extracting some of it to use in the factory's systems, we are saving enough water to meet the average daily consumption of 6 400 people in the surrounding area. The new technology used at the factory in Jalisco, Mexico, heats milk at low pressure to remove some of the water. The resulting steam is then condensed and treated and used to clean machines. It is then recycled and used again. The process reduces by 15% the total amount of water used by Nestlé Mexico. Work is now underway to deploy similar technology in five other manufacturing sites in water stressed areas around the world. It is just one of a number of water-saving initiatives we have introduced in recent years, allowing us to reduce total water withdrawal in absolute terms by almost one third in the last decade.

The Zone's organic growth was supported by double-digit growth for Nescafé Dolce Gusto and strong performances in ambient dairy and petcare. In North America growth improved towards the end of the year while in Latin America good growth was helped by pricing, reflecting inflationary pressures. Our performance in North America was affected by the frozen category. Projects are underway to reposition Lean Cuisine, Hot Pockets and Stouffers. They address all elements of the marketing mix, reflecting trends such as organic and ethnic, enhancing the brands' relevance to consumers. We are taking the same approach in frozen pizza where our California Pizza Kitchen did well. In ice cream the super premium segment performed well with Gelato, and snacks returned to growth, although the premium segment was subdued. In confectionery the successful roll-out of Butterfinger Peanut Butter Cups continued. Innovations like Natural Bliss and seasonal renovations of flavours helped Coffee-mate deliver good growth. Innovation also ensured the petcare business in North America continued to grow with Dog Chow, Pro Plan and Tidy Cats Lightweight cat litter as highlights."

Latin America delivered good organic growth despite a worsening of the macroeconomic situation towards the end of the year. Although consumer sentiment varied across the region, most markets did well. All Brazil's categories grew, with Ninho in growing-up milks, KitKat in confectionery, Nesfit in biscuits and Nescau in cocoa and malt beverages making strong contributions. In Mexico the changes in fiscal legislation, pricing and subdued consumer demand affected the market. Nescafé Dolce Gusto delivered double-digit growth across the region, while Dog Chow and Pro Plan drove sales in the petcare business. Despite higher input costs the Zone's trading operating profit margin improved by 60 basis points to 18.8%, reflecting operational and structural efficiencies and lower other trading expenses. Zone Europe Sales of CHF 15.2 billion, 1.5% organic growth, 2.2% real internal growth; 15.3% trading operating profit margin, +30 basis points. Relative to the market this was good growth, driven by innovation and premiumisation.

The Great Britain region, Germany, Italy and Greece were more challenged. There were strong performances from petcare and Nescafé Dolce Gusto across Western Europe and we saw good growth from innovations in several categories. Highlights included Nescafé Gold and Azzera premium soluble coffee, Fresh Up and Buitoni Fiesta in frozen pizza, Maggi snacking noodles in ambient culinary and the launch of premium chocolate tablets Les Recettes de l'Atelier in France. In Central and Eastern Europe, Russia and Ukraine drove the growth in a deteriorating economic environment. Petcare, Nescafé Dolce Gusto, soluble coffee, particularly Gold Blend, and confectionery with KitKat were the highlights. The ongoing roll-out of Papyrus cooking papers in ambient culinary also continued to do well. Petcare delivered broad-based growth across the Zone, further strengthening its positions, in particular through the premium category with Felix, Purina ONE and Gourmet, and our snacks range.

Therefore, in addition to correcting trade stocks throughout the year, we focused on innovation, on reformulation and on re-launches, particularly in coffee, ready-to-drink and confectionery. We continued to see good performances in ambient culinary, ice cream and ready-todrink coffee. In Oceania we are focused on developing new trade channels. Strong growth continued in most other emerging markets, in particular the Philippines, South Asia, the Indochina region, Turkey and many markets in Africa.

Nespresso continued to drive the expansion of the global single-serve coffee market with the successful launch of the VertuoLine system in North America creating a new premium coffee segment. The roll-out of the innovative automated retail boutique, the Nespresso Cube, is pioneering a new way of shopping and a personalised service for consumers. Nestlé Health Science continued to develop nutritional therapies that have proven clinical benefit and health economic value.

text,58,0,data/raw/Nestle_2014_auto-paragraph-parsing.pdf,"55 Nestlé Annual Report 2014 Group Risk Management The Nestlé Group Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERM) is designed to identify, communicate, and mitigate risks in order to minimise their potential impact on the Group. Nestlé has adopted a dual approach in identifying and assessing risks. A top-down assessment is performed at Group level once a year to create a good understanding of the company's mega-risks, to allocate ownership to drive specific actions around them and take any relevant steps to address them. A bottom-up assessment occurs in parallel annually and focuses on the global risk portfolio in the businesses/ corporate functions. It involves the aggregation of individual assessments by the Zones, Globally Managed Businesses and all markets. It is intended to provide a high-level risk mapping and allows Group Management to make sound decisions on the future operations of the company and ensure that any risk growing in importance within the organisation is captured and addressed in Nestlé's ERM agenda. In 2014, a total of 42 risk assessments were performed and updated. An annual compliance risk assessment is performed in the Group Compliance Committee. Risk assessments are the responsibility of line management; this applies equally to a business, a market or a function, and any mitigating actions identified in the assessments are the responsibility of the individual line management. If Group-level intervention is required, responsibility for mitigating actions will generally be determined by the Executive Board. The results of the Group ERM are presented annually to the Executive Board and to the Audit Committee, and conclusions reported to the Board of Directors. Nestlé uses the outcome of stakeholder meetings to better understand potential gaps between internal and external perception of risks and their impact on reputation. Factors affecting results Nestlé's reputation is based on consumers' trust."

The Group has policies, processes, controls and regular monitoring (dedicated dashboard with relevant KPIs) in place to prevent such events. The success of the Nestlé Group depends on its ability to anticipate consumer preferences and to offer high-quality, appealing products. The Group's business is subject to some seasonality, and adverse weather conditions may impact sales. The food industry as a whole is faced with the global challenge of increasing obesity. The Group makes all its products available in a range of sizes and varieties designed to meet all needs and all occasions. Nestlé is dependent on the sustainable supply of a number of raw materials, packaging materials and services/utilities. Any major event triggered by natural hazards (drought, flood, etc.), change in macroeconomic environment (shift in production patterns, biofuels, excessive trading, etc.), resulting in input price volatilities and/or capacity constraints, could potentially impact Nestlé's financial results. The Group has policies, processes, controls and regular monitoring in place to (if ever possible) anticipate such events and adequately mitigate against them. Nestlé manages risks and opportunities related to climate change proactively given the impact it may have on agriculture and food production systems. The Group's liquidities/liabilities (currency fluctuation, inter - est rate, derivatives, and/or hedging, pension funding obligations/retirement benefits, banking/commercial credit, and cost of capital, etc.) could be impacted by any major event in the financial markets.

text,62,0,data/raw/Nestle_2014_auto-paragraph-parsing.pdf,"59 Nestlé Annual Report 2014 For our company to be successful over the long term and create value for shareholders, it must create value for society. Our approach to Creating Shared Value is built upon a set of strong principles and values set by the Board of Directors. In our governance, our Board of Directors plays a central role, among other things, for our long-term strategy; company values, culture and 'tone at the top'; the oversight of management and long-term performance; financial planning and audit process; risk oversight, compliance and integrity; compensation and performance goals; director nomination and evaluation; succession planning; and our engagement with shareholders and other stakeholders. In this report, we give examples of our key strategies, critical developments in 2014 and an outlook on the future. We aim to give insights into our strategy, factors that affect our ability to create value over time and our relationship with key stakeholders. Our Nestlé in society report includes both our financial and nonfinancial commitments in line with the UN Global Compact and the Global Reporting Initiative. It reflects our continuous journey towards integrated reporting. Our Corporate Governance Report describes how our governance ensures the effectiveness of our Board. In 2014, we were an early adopter of new Swiss governance requirements; the related revision of our Articles of Association was adopted by a strong majority of our shareholders. Our Compensation Report explains our compensation system and pay-outs and is submitted annually to a separate advisory vote of our shareholders. In 2015, we will for the first time submit the compensation of our Board of Directors and Executive Board for approval by our shareholders. We regularly review our governance against legal requirements and best practices."

We follow applicable laws and our own commitments across the ten Corporate Business Principles, including our commitments to integrity in the Code of Business Conduct, to maintain sustainable trust with employees, shareholders and other stakeholders. While compliance is a leadership responsibility, line management is supported by all functions engaged in our riskand principles-based compliance programme. A dedicated Corporate Compliance function and a cross-functional Compliance Committee define the framework, facilitate coordination and provide guidance and best practices. Under our custodian concept, our Market Heads play a critical role for compliance. Market Compliance Officers and committees ensure a consistent approach and help identify local compliance priorities. The right tone at the top is reflected in our Corporate Business Principles, our Management and Leadership Principles, our Code of Business Conduct and our Supplier Code. Awareness campaigns and regular risk assessments help us in their continuous implementation. Proper consequence management is reinforced by our performance evaluation system, which includes an assessment of ""how"" goals were accomplished. We monitor compliance through our corporate functions, internal and external audit, as well as our CARE programme relying on independent external auditors. 120 audits were conducted in 2014 and gaps addressed. In 2014, we addressed 920 complaints from employees through our integrity reporting system, which complements our ombudsman system for WHO Code compliance. Our new Tell Us reporting system allowed us to address 87 complaints from suppliers and other third parties. All complaints are investigated and remedial action taken."
