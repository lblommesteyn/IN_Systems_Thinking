      "text": "The Boxer is a medium to large breed developed in Germany in the 19th century from the now-extinct Bullenbeisser and the English Bulldog. Originally used for bull-baiting, bear-hunting, and later as butcher's assistants, modern Boxers are versatile working dogs and beloved family companions. They have a short, smooth coat typically in fawn or brindle, often with white markings. Boxers are known for their playful, energetic temperament and patience with children. They're intelligent and respond well to positive reinforcement training but can be stubborn. Despite their muscular appearance, they're gentle and affectionate with their families. Boxers require regular exercise and mental stimulation. They're prone to certain health conditions including heart problems, cancer, and hip dysplasia.",

      "text": "Therapy dogs are specially trained and evaluated canines that provide comfort, affection, and support in various settings including hospitals, nursing homes, schools, and disaster areas. Unlike service dogs, therapy dogs don't have special access rights and work with multiple people rather than assisting a specific individual with disabilities. Successful therapy dogs have calm, friendly temperaments, enjoy human interaction, and remain composed in various environments with different sounds, smells, and equipment. Popular therapy dog breeds include Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, and Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, though dogs of any breed can serve as therapy dogs if they have the right temperament. Research shows that interaction with therapy dogs can reduce stress hormones, lower blood pressure, and improve mood in people experiencing illness, trauma, or stress.",

      "text": "Canine parvovirus (parvo) is a highly contagious viral disease that primarily affects unvaccinated puppies and young dogs. The virus attacks rapidly dividing cells, particularly in the intestinal tract, bone marrow, and heart in very young puppies. It's transmitted through direct contact with infected dogs or contaminated feces, environments, or objects. The virus is extremely hardy and can survive in the environment for months or years. Symptoms include severe vomiting, bloody diarrhea, lethargy, fever, and loss of appetite, leading to life-threatening dehydration and secondary infections. Treatment involves intensive supportive care including IV fluids, anti-nausea medications, antibiotics, and careful monitoring. Vaccination is highly effective at preventing the disease and is considered a core vaccine that all dogs should receive.",

Their name means 'lion dog' in Mandarin, reflecting their resemblance to the mythical Chinese lion. Shih Tzus have a long, flowing double coat that requires daily brushing and regular grooming to prevent matting. They typically weigh between 9-16 pounds and have a distinctive flat face, large eyes, and a friendly expression. Despite their small size, they have a solid build and confident carriage. Shih Tzus are known for their outgoing, affectionate temperament and adaptability to various living situations. They're generally good with children and other pets. While they enjoy short walks, they don't require extensive exercise, making them suitable for apartment living.",

      "text": "Resource guarding is a natural canine behavior where dogs protect valuable items such as food, toys, sleeping locations, or even people. While it served an evolutionary purpose for wild canids, it can become problematic in domestic settings. Signs range from subtle (freezing, whale eye) to severe (growling, snapping, biting). Resource guarding is often misunderstood as dominance, but it's actually rooted in anxiety and fear of losing something valuable. Treatment involves counterconditioning to change the dog's emotional response, teaching alternative behaviors, and management strategies to prevent incidents. Punishment should be avoided as it can increase anxiety and aggression. Early intervention is important, as resource guarding tends to escalate if not addressed. For severe cases, working with a professional dog behaviorist is recommended.",

      "text": "The Corgi comes in two distinct breeds: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Both were developed in Wales as herding dogs, using their low stature to nip at the heels of cattle while avoiding kicks. Pembrokes are more popular and typically have a shorter body, pointed ears, and either no tail or a docked tail. Cardigans have a longer body, rounded ears, and a long, fox-like tail. Both breeds have short legs, a thick double coat, and an alert, intelligent expression. Corgis are known for their bold personality, intelligence, and surprising athleticism despite their short legs. They form strong bonds with their families and can be vocal. While they're small enough for apartment living, they have high energy levels and require regular exercise to prevent obesity and behavioral issues.",

      "text": "Canine enrichment refers to activities and environmental modifications that stimulate a dog's mind, encourage natural behaviors, and improve quality of life. Enrichment can be categorized into several types: cognitive (puzzle toys, training), sensory (novel scents, sounds, textures), social (interaction with people and other animals), feeding (food puzzles, foraging opportunities), and physical (varied environments, agility equipment). Regular enrichment helps prevent boredom and associated behavioral problems like destructive chewing, excessive barking, and anxiety. It's particularly important for high-intelligence breeds, working dogs without jobs, and dogs left alone for extended periods. Simple enrichment activities include snuffle mats for foraging, rotating toys to maintain novelty, scatter feeding, and creating obstacle courses with household items. Enrichment should be tailored to each dog's preferences, abilities, and energy level.",

They have a distinctive tricolor coat (black with rust and white markings) that is thick, long, and requires regular brushing. Bernese Mountain Dogs typically weigh between 70-115 pounds and have a gentle, calm temperament despite their imposing size. They're known for their loyalty, affection toward family members, and patience with children. While they enjoy outdoor activities, particularly in cool weather, they don't require extensive exercise and are often content to relax at home.

Unlike emotional support animals or therapy dogs, service dogs have legal public access rights. Types of service dogs include guide dogs for the visually impaired, hearing dogs for the deaf, mobility assistance dogs, psychiatric service dogs, and medical alert dogs that can detect changes in blood sugar or oncoming seizures. Training typically takes 1-2 years and includes basic obedience, public access skills, and task-specific training. Breeds commonly used as service dogs include Labrador Retrievers, Golden Retrievers, and German Shepherds, though any breed with the right temperament and physical capabilities can be trained. Service dogs must be well-behaved in public settings and focused on their handler despite distractions.",
